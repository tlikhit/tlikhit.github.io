Welcome to my little corner of the internet!
I've recently decided to start blogging as a means of self introspection.
Check out some of my projects below, including some toy projects hosted on codepen.

[Faze](/) | Materialize, jQuery, Pytorch/fastai, Uvicorn, Starlette
- A web app for enhancing blurry or low resolution images of people with deep learning.
- Used a custom trained model (GAN) optimized for humans, ensuring boost in quality relative to other approaches.\
**Note**: This was pulled down after I ran out of credits :(\
However, I'm actively working on an optimized model and plan on rolling it out in the next few weeks!
