# About

Hey there, nice to meet you! I'm a first year student pursuing a Computer Science degree at the University of Toronto.
I'm intrigued by almost anything and everything. Currently learning more about meta-learning(i.e. learning to learn).
I occasionally participate in data science contests on Kaggle, mostly dealing with image and tabular data.
In my free time, I swim, gym, run, and play the piano.
