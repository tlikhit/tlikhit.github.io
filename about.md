# About

Hey, nice to meet you!\
I'm a first year CS undergrad at the University of Toronto.\
I'm intrigued by almost anything and everything. Currently learning more about meta-learning(i.e. learning to learn).\
I occasionally participate in data science contests on Kaggle, mostly dealing with image and tabular data.\
In my free time, I swim, gym, run, and play the piano.\
Also am constantly looking for book recs!
